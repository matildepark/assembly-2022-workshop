#   Assembly Workshop Â· ~2022.9.24

_Flappy Bird_ is an "insanely irritating, difficult and frustrating game which combines a super-steep difficulty curve with bad, boring graphics and jerky movement."  We are going to implement a _Flappy Bird_ leaderboard using `%pals` and an off-the-shelf FOSS JavaScript game.

We need to make the following:

1. Build front end.  The FOSS app _simpliciter_ satisfies this to start.
2. Build data model.  We need to build the Gall agent.
3. Connect the game to the backend.  We need to make some few modifications to the front end.
4. Make friends talk to each other.  We need to hook up `%pals`.

Full instructions will be shared at or after [Assembly 2022 Miami](https://assembly.urbit.org/).
